List mounted devices:
  #df -h
    Shows mounted devices and space on them.
  #df -T
    Shows file system type as well (to differentiate real file system opposed to kerenl interface)
    Use "-m" to show size in mebibytes.
  #mount
  $findmnt
    Shows relations between mounts.
  The real devices in the output start with /dev (which refers to the directory that is used to store device files).

Listing files in current directory:
  #ls
    Options:
      -a shows hidden files (git files for example)
      -l gives long listing (every file in new row with sizes permissions and timestamps)
      -t sort on modification time newest files first
      -r revert sorting order
      -d Match a directory (use with wildcards)
      -R Shows the contents of the current directory, in addition to all of its subdirectories; that is, it Recursively descends all subdirectories.

Copying files:
  Copy hidden and regular files to current directory:
    #cp -a /home/$USER/. .

  Copy entire folder into current directory and save it in folder with the same name:
    #cp -a /home/$USER .

  Copy entire directory with all of its content:
    #cp -R

  To copy current permissions of files use:
    #cp -a

Symbolic links:
  Link to name of file.
  To create hard links, you must be the owner of the item that you want to link to.
  Create symbolic link:
    #ln -s SCOURCE DESTRINATION

Create file:
  #touch FILE_NAME

Hidden files starts with a dot "."

Hard links:
  Hard links must exist all on the same device.
  You cannot create hard links to directories.
  The number of aliases the original file has. When the last name is removed, the contents are also removed.
  No difference exists between the first hard link and the second hard link.
  Link to "inode".
  Create link:
    #ln /etc/hosts .
    #ln SCOURCE DESTINATION

Archives:
  Using tar:
    Create tar archives:
      #tar -cf NAME.tar /files
      To see what is happening use "-v".
      Read permission is needed to put files to tar.
    Add file to existing archives:
      #tar -rvf NAME.tar files
        Option "-r".
    Update (overwrite) existing archives:
      $tar -uvf NAME.tar files
        Option "-u".
    List content of tar archives:
      #tar -tvf NAME.tar
        Option "-t".
    Extract tar archives:
      #tar -xvf NAME.tar
        Option "-c".
        Extracted to current directory.
      #tar -xvf NAME.tar -C DESTINATION
        Option "-C".
        Extract to DESTINATION directory.
      #tar -xvf NAME.tar FILE_NAME
        Extract only FILE_NAME from tar archive to current directory.
    Compression:
     Use option "-z" (gzip) or "-j" (bzip2) while creating archive.
     No option for extracting.

Compress files:
  #gzip home.tar
    New file is created: "home.tar.gz"
  Alternative: "bzip2".

Decompress files:
  #gunzip
  #bunzip2

Find out file type:
    #file NAME_OF_FILE
