Syntax:
  #mount labipa.example.com:/data /mnt
    Key part is "servername:/sharename",

To enable Kerberos:
  Add "sec=krb5[ip]" option to "mount".
  Service "nfs-secure" must be started.

Discover shares on NFS:
  Use "root" mount.
  #netstat -an | grep your.nfs.server.ip:port
  #showmount -e nfsserver

Mounting an NFS Share:
  #yum install -y nfs-utils to
  Log in as root to the labipa machine. Use ssh root@192.168.122.200
    #systemctl stop firewalld
  On local server: #showmount -e nfsserver
  On labipa : #systemctl start firewalld
  Root mount:
    #mount 192.168.122.200:/ /mnt
      All NFS shares.
  Verify mount:
    #mount | grep 122 to
    #ls /mnt

Mounting SMB File Systems (Samba):
  Packets needed: "cifs-utils" and "samba-client"
    #yum install -y cifs-utils samba-client
  Add samba-client service to firewall:
    #firewall-cmd --add-service samba-client --permanent; firewall-cmd --reload
  Discover SMB shares:
    #smbclient -L 192.168.122.201
      Press "Enter" when asked for password.
      Option "-Uusername" to user valid Samba user account.
    Alternative:
      #net share -l

  Mount SMB Share:
    #mount -t cifs -o user=guest //192.168.122.200/data /mnt
      Option "-t cifs" is optional it says that we are mounting SMB share.
      Option "-o user=guest" is to authenticate without password.
        Only read permission.
      Option "-o username=someone":
        To authenticate as valid user.

  From GUI:
    "Places > Browse Network"
    Add a server:
      "Network > Connect to Server"
        Format "smb://ipa.example.com/data" "smb://servername/sharename"

Mount automatically:
  NFS using "fstab":
    Add line "server1:/share /nfs/mount/point nfs,_netdev,x-systemd.automount, sync 0 0"
  SMB using "fstab":
    Add line: ""
      User credential:
        "username="" and "password=""
        It is better to use credential file:
          Put it in the home directory of the root user, set the owners to root:root, and set the permission mode 600.
            Example of file:
              "username=linda
              password=secret
              domain=mydomain"
          To use file from command line use option "-o credentials= filename":
            #mount -t cifs -o credentials=/root/creds //server1/data /mnt/data
          To use file from "/etc/fstab":
            #//server1/data /mnt/data cifs _netdev,, x-systemd.automount,credentials=/root/creds 0 0

Using Automount:
  Mounted on demand and not by default.
  Package "autofs".
    #yum install -y autofs
  Create file in "etc/auto.master.d" it must end with "autofs".
    Indirect mapping:
      Add line "/shares /etc/auto.demo"
      In file "/etc/auto.demo":
        Add line "data -rw,sync labipa:/data".
          It will be mounted in "/shares/data"
    Direct mapping:
      Add line "/- /etc/auto.direct"
      In file "/etc/auto.direct":
        Add a line "/mnt -rw,sync labipa:/home".
      For both run:
        #systemctl enable autofs; systemctl start autofs

  Configure indirect mount, where home directories are mounted on /home/guests:
    In "/etc/auto.master.d/home.autofs":
      Add a line "/home/guests /etc/auto.homes".
      In "/etc/auto.homes":
        Add a line "* -rw,sync labipa:/home/ldap/&"
      #systemctl restart autofs

  Same procedure for SBM:
    If you want to use a credentials file, make sure to include the absolute path to that file (such as /root/filename.cre) in the mount options.
    The name of the share that should be mount should start with a colon (:). All devices that are mounted in automount and have a name that starts with a / should be prepended by a colon.
