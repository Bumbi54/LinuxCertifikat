Event journal:
  Collects messages from the kernel, the entire boot procedure, and services.
  Access it with:
    #journalctl
    Not persistent between reboots.
    #journalctl -f
      See last message.
    #journalctl -p err
      Shows errors only.
    #journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=sshd.service
    #journalctl -o verbose
  To make it persistent directory "/var/log/journal" must exist.
    #chown root:systemd-journal /var/log/journal
    #chmod 2755 /var/log/journal
    #reboot
    Logs from last reboot:
      #journalctl -b
  Configuration file:
    #/etc/systemd/journald.conf

Log about specific service:
  #systemctl status httpd
    Show last few entries.

Log are saved in "/var/log/"
  -/var/log/messages - The most commonly used log file, it is the generic log file where most messages are written to.
  -/var/log/dmesg - Contains kernel log messages.
  -/var/log/secure - Contains authentication related messages. Look here to see which authentication errors have occurred on a server.
  -/var/log/boot.log - Look here for messages that are related to system startup.
  -/var/log/audit/audit.log - Contains audit messages. SELinux writes to this file.
  -/var/log/maillog - Look here for mail-related messages.
  -/var/log/samba - Provides log files for the Samba service. Notice that Samba by default is not managed through rsyslog, but writes directly to the /var/log directory.
  -/var/log/sssd - Contains messages that have been written by the sssd service, which plays an important role in the authentication process.
  -/var/log/cups - Contains log messages that were generated by the print service CUPS.
  -/var/log/httpd/ Directory that contains log files that are written by the Apache web server. Notice that Apache writes messages to these files directly and not through rsyslog.

Write messages from commands :
  #logger
  #logger -p kern.err message
    Writes message to the kernel facility, for example, using the error priority.

Configure rsyslogd:
  "/etc/rsyslog.conf"
    Use "local0 through local7" facilities for services that are not predefined.
  Files in "/etc/rsyslog.d/"
  Pass options on startup:
    "/etc/sysconfig/rsyslog"
    Line "SYSLOGD_OTIONS=“” ".

  Example:
    In service that we want to log add "ErrorLog syslog:local1".
    Add line in "/etc/rsyslog.conf":
      local1:error -/var/log/httpd-error.log
        Everything error and above.
      local1.=error -/var/log/httpd-error.log
        Only error.
    Restart service:
      #systemctl restart rsyslogd
  Create a snap-in file that logs debug messages to a specific file as well. To do this, type echo “*.debug /var/log/messages/messages-debug” > /etc/rsyslogd/debug.conf

Rotate log files:
  #logrotate
  Configuration in "/etc/logrotate.conf".
  Configuration for specific files:
    /etc/logrotate.d/
