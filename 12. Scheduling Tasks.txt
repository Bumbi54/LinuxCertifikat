Check cron service status:
  #systemctl status crond -l

Crond examples:
  #man 5 crontab

To create crond job for a specific user:
  #crontab -e -u username
  In general user is not specified.

Put files in "/etc/cron.d" directory:
  Example of file:
    #10 3 1 * * unbound /usr/sbin/unbound-anchor -a /var/lib/unbound/root. anchor -c /etc/unbound/icannbundle.pem
      First part "10 3 1 * *":
        On 3:10 every first in moth.
      Second part user:
        "unbound"
      Third part, command that will be executed:
        #/usr/sbin/unbound-anchor -a /var/lib/unbound/root.anchor -c /etc/unbound/icannbundle.pem

Job can be scheduled in directories:
  ■ etc/cron.hourly
  ■ /etc/cron.daily
  ■ /etc/cron.weekly
  ■ /etc/cron.monthly

  Scripts must be executable:
    #chmod +x SCRIPT

  There is no time part in scripts in this folders.

Use of anacron:
  #/etc/anacrontab

List cron jobs for current user:
  #crontab-l

Allow which user can access cron:
  "/etc/cron.allow"

Deny user from accessing cron:
  "/etc/cron.deny"

Schedule execution only once:
  #atd TIME(14:00)
    To close use CTRL + D
  #atq
    List queue.
  #atrm
    #Remove from queue.
  #atd -l 3.0
    Make sure that no batch job is started when system load is higher than 3.0.
