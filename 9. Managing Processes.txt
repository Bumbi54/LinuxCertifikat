To send signal to process:
  #kill
  ■ The signal SIGTERM (15) is used to ask a process to stop.
  ■ The signal SIGKILL (9) is used to force a process to stop.
  ■ The SIGHUP (1) signal is used to hang up a process. The effect is that the process will reread its configuration files, which makes this a useful signal to use after making modifications to a process configuration file.
