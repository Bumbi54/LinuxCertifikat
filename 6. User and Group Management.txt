  this file, you can include messages to be displayed after the user has successfully
  logged in to the server.

  searched for executable files after logging in.

  the default password expiration properties when creating new users.

Logging In Through an External Authentication Service (LDAP):
  Three tools for setting up LDAP Authentication:
    authconfig - command line
    authconfig-tui - menu driven (nslcd)
    authconfig-gtk - GUI (sssd)

    Configuration file of "nslcd":
      /etc/nslcd.conf

    After configuration check status:
      #systemctl status nslcd

    Configuration file of "sssd":
      /etc/sss/sssd.conf

    When you use authconfig-tui, the variable FORCELEGACY=yes is set in /etc/sysconfig/authconfig. This makes that nslcd is used instead of sssd.

    Step before using any command:
      yum groupinstall -y “Directory Client”
      scp ipa.example.com:/root/cacert.p12 /etc/openldap/cacerts

    For authconfig-tui:
      Make sure the base DN is set to dc=example,dc=com (LDAP domain "ipa.example.com")
      Open the file /etc/nslcd.conf and make sure that it contains the line tls_reqcert never.
      Use systemctl restart nslcd to restart the nslcd service.

Host file:
  Set new name resolution:
    192.168.122.200 ipa.example.com
